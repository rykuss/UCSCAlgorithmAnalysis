# UCSCAlgorithmAnalysis
All my work from "CMPS 102: Algorithm Analysis", an advanced Algorithm Analysis Class. This Repo is filled primarily with written out Psuedo Code and Reasonings.
I've put this HW up for professional reasons, so that an employer or otherwise can see how I think as a programmer.

There were four main HW assignments for the class, each significantly challenging and worth a sizable chunk of the grade. 
I've uploaded my work but I cannot guarantee the correctness of any of the solutions. 

With the exception of HW4, I've attached a pdf for each homework assignment listing the questions. The solutions are broken into parts.
